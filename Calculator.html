<h1> Calculator <h2>

Me and Carlos made a calculator. You type in any digits you want, including negative numbers, then you can either multiply, divide, subtract, or add them.
We had to do a lot of research online, but we ended up figuring it out.

Click <a href="https://github.com/AsahelF/AsahelF.Github.io/blob/master/Calculator.py">here</a> to see the code

 The first picture just shows you the actual calculator and how it looks, the 2nd picture shows you an example problem on the calculator, and the last picture shows you a snippet of code,
which put the clear button on the bottom of the calculator and tells it to function there.
